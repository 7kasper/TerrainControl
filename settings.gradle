include 'common', 'platforms/bukkit', 'platforms/forge'

/*
 * The 'platforms' module isn't included at the moment. This
 * file should create a jar with both the Bukkit and Forge version in it.
 * However, Gradle tries to rebuild 'platforms/bukkit' and 'platforms/forge'
 * when creating that file. This corrupts the MCP/ForgeGradle cache, making
 * everything very slow. For now, it is probably better to create the
 * universal jar file yourself by putting all classes together with something
 * like 7-zip.
